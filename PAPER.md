PAPER.md

* like FSW, but with a focus on ease of use, mobile, natural
	* entice people to express themselves (but not as a form of publication)
	* progressive disclosure (like-minded peers, coauthors, co-editors)

* by default, a wiki has only one public page (front door)
* creating a new wiki generally happens by spawning one off of an existing node in the federation
* wiki-wiki connections are stronger than page-page connections (good idea?)

* fuzzy boundaries between authoring, refactoring, curating, publishing

* easier to start a new page, to rename (which makes making mistakes easier) -> easier to write
* easier to curate search results (both from wiki, federation and web) -> easier to curate
still need:
* easier to make reusable, generative.  
	* easier to reward people for making generative
* easier to refactor one-off into formulas
	* from a recipe wiki page to a Recipe
